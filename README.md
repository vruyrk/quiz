Priority Queue is more specialized data structure than Queue. In priority queue our items are ordered by key value with defines their priority. If it has the lowest value means that it is at front and if it has the highest value means it is at back. So we can conclude, if the value is lower then the priority is higher, and the vice versa for the lower value. There are some operations that we use for the priority queue, which are Insert/Enqueue, Remove/Dequeue. For the first operation it adds an item to the back, and for the second operation it removes and item form the front. Last but not least, there are few more operations supported by queue, that are Peek, which gets the element at front, isFull, which checks if queue is full and is Empty, which checks if queue is empty.
